# Changelog

## Unreleased

## v0.1.6 - 2026-06-16

<!-- derived-from ./docs/language-reference.md#relationship-predicates -->
<!-- derived-from ./docs/cli-reference.md#export -->
<!-- derived-from ./docs/state-derivation.md#diagnostics -->

### Added

- Added first-class business-flow modeling with `flow`, `step`, `precedes`,
  `branches`, `excepts`, `repeats`, and `covers`.
- Added richer requirement, ADR, NFR, quality, constraint, conceptual-model,
  screen-field, DTO, and API contract vocabulary.
- Added data-modeling annotations for indexes, composite constraints, checks,
  FK optionality/actions, soft delete, history, tenant scope, and derived columns.
- Added OpenAPI, AsyncAPI, DBML, JSON Schema, Mermaid ER, and PlantUML ER exports.
- Added diagram filtering, view presets, diff diagrams, and description rendering.
- Added `rdra-ish lint` and `rdra-ish fmt` for model readiness and formatting.

### Changed

- System ownership can now be declared with `owns(System, Entity)` and compared
  against API-derived ownership diagnostics.
- Relation-scoped `.along(...)` cross constraints now evaluate representative
  operation-linked cases instead of always falling back to global cross-product
  behavior.
- Skill definitions under `skills/` now guide modeling with the expanded DSL
  vocabulary and release/export review paths.

### Breaking Changes

<!-- derived-from ./docs/language-reference.md#file-structure-and-comments -->

- Line comments in `.rdra` files use `//`.
- Legacy `#` line comments are not accepted by the parser. Existing models that used
  `#` comments must migrate those lines to `//`.

### Migration: `#` Comments to `//`

Use a mechanical line-comment replacement for `.rdra` sources:

```sh
find path/to/model -name '*.rdra' -exec perl -pi -e 's/^(\s*)#/$1\/\//' {} +
```

Review the result if your model uses `#` inside string literals or external snippets.
Block comments remain available as `/* ... */`.
