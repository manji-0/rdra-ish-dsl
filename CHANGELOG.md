## Unreleased

### Breaking Changes

<!-- derived-from ./docs/language-reference.md#file-structure-and-comments -->

- Line comments in `.rdra` files use `//`.
- Legacy `#` line comments are not accepted by the parser. Existing models that used
  `#` comments must migrate those lines to `//`.

### Migration: `#` Comments to `//`

Use a mechanical line-comment replacement for `.rdra` sources:

```sh
find path/to/model -name '*.rdra' -exec perl -pi -e 's/^(\s*)#/$1\/\//' {} +
```

Review the result if your model uses `#` inside string literals or external snippets.
Block comments remain available as `/* ... */`.
